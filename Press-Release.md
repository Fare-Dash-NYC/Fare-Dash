# Fare-Dash-NYC
## Press Release
> Fare Evasion to prison pipeline.

## Summary
> The MTA released slides showing fare evasion rising to historically high levels on subways and even more so on buses. 
> They are pushing a false fare evasion narrative, targeting black and brown New Yorkers. Fare evasion is a criminal offense. 
> If convicted, you may get a criminal record and pay a fine of up to $100. 

## Product Overview
> This application provides resources for NYC youths and people from low-income families who cannot afford train/car fares.

## Problem 
> Police officers are hiding in train stations, to get people who cannot afford the $2.75 fee. 
> Theyâ€™re preying on black youth, using that as an excuse to stop and frisk and tarnish their records.

## Solution
> This application allows users to donate to someone's CashApp/Venmo towards transit costs - submit the receipt of the donation.
> Users can Sign up to receive a metro card using a cash app/Venmo link - As a way to let us know they received it.
> Also provides resources to Fair Fares and a direct link to dispute fare evasion ticket.

## Key Technical Challenge 
> Our most challenging technical challenge will be trying to implement the payment system. 
> For our MVP we decided that the person receiving the donation would provide their cash app. 

## Extension opportunities
> For extensions, we plan on making the payments direct which means there wouldn't be any cash app necessary only bank account info.
