# Fare-Dash-NYC

## Press Release

> Fare Dash aims to keep low-income commuters safe from police harassment and help them avoid high fines to make our public transit system more just. 

## Fare Evasion to prison pipeline. 

> New Yorkers are constantly under the threat of police harassment and brutality in our subway systems. With Fare Dash, New Yorkers are more informed about police presences and keep themselves safe from stop & frisk, high fines, and the over-policing of our public transit system.
> 
## Mission Statement

> By designing our app, we hope to keep our community inform of police presence in train stations, and also provide them with ressources to assist them with bus/train pass to combat fare evasion and keep the youth out of the criminal justice system.

## Summary
> Fare evasion is a criminal offense. If convicted, you may get a criminal record and pay a fine of up to $100. If low-income public transit users had access to ressources that helped with MTA fares and were made aware of cop presence in the subways , fewer people will suffer from police harassment and high fines.


## Problem 
Police officers are hiding in train stations, to get people who cannot afford the $2.75 fee. Theyâ€™re preying on black youth, using that as an excuse to stop and frisk and to fill their monthly quotas.


## Solution
>  This application allows users to report police presence and stay away from high concentrated areas.
>  Less youth being stopped, less people entering criminal justice system for petty crime.
>  Provides resources to Fair Fares and a direct link to dispute fare evasion tickets.


## Key Technical Challenge 
>  Our most challenging technical challenge will be trying to implement the map and user authentication. We have set up routes, and database endpoints. In addition, we want to use Google API to map stations by making request to get live datas and send it to our front end. We want users to be able to click on a station that will then navigate them to a page that will show a report, we will also add the ability for users to create reports and edit them at will.


## Extension opportunities
> For extensions, We will show icons and identifiers on the map. We will add a search bar where users can look up report for specific stations, In addition we will link NYC half fare metro cards where qualified users can metro cards half-priced.
