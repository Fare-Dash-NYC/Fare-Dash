# Fare-Dash-NYC
## Press Release
> Fare Evasion to prison pipeline.

## Summary
> The MTA released slides showing fare evasion rising to historically high levels on subways and even more so on buses. 
> They are pushing a false fare evasion narrative, targeting black and brown New Yorkers. Fare evasion is a criminal offense. 
> If convicted, you may get a criminal record and pay a fine of up to $100. Our goal is to keep people aware/notified of police presence in train stations.

## Problem 
> Police officers are hiding in train stations, to get people who cannot afford the $2.75 fee. 
> Theyâ€™re preying on black youth, using that as an excuse to stop and frisk and to fill their monthly quotas.  

## Solution
> - This application allows users to report police presence and stay away from high concentrated area.
> - less youth being stopped, less people entering crininal justice system for petty crime.
> - Also provides resources to Fair Fares and a direct link to dispute fare evasion ticket.

## Key Technical Challenge 
> Our most challenging technical challenge will be trying to implement the heat map. 

## Extension opportunities
> For extensions, showing icons and identifiers on the map.
