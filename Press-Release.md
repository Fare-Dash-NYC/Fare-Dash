# Fare-Dash-NYC
## Press Release
> Fare Evasion to prison pipeline. 

## Mission Statement
> Fare Dash is a platform that provides real-time updates of police sightings at stations, and access to reduced MTA fare by allowing users to make onsite reports of police activity and gifting a metro card to those who are eligible with the goal of decreasing the number of people receiving $100 fines for fare evasion. 

## Summary
> The MTA released slides showing fare evasion rising to historically high levels on subways and even more so on buses. 
> They are pushing a false fare evasion narrative, targeting black and brown New Yorkers. Fare evasion is a criminal offense. 
> If convicted, you may get a criminal record and pay a fine of up to $100. If low-income public transit users had access to ressources that helped with MTA fares and were made aware of cop presence in the subways , fewer people will suffer from police harassment and high fines.


## Problem 
> Police officers are hiding in train stations, to get people who cannot afford the $2.75 fee. 
> Theyâ€™re preying on black youth, using that as an excuse to stop and frisk and to fill their monthly quotas.By designing our app, we hope to keep our community inform of police presence in train stations, and also provide them with ressources to assist them with bus/train pass to combat fare evasion and keep the youth out of the criminal justice system.

## Solution
> - This application allows users to report police presence and stay away from high concentrated areas.
> - Less youth being stopped, less people entering criminal justice system for petty crime.
> - Provides resources to Fair Fares and a direct link to dispute fare evasion tickets.

## Key Technical Challenge 
>  Our most challenging technical challenge will be trying to implement the heat map and user authentication. We have set up routes, and database endpoints. In addition, we want to use Google API to map stations by making request to get live datas and send it to our front end. We want users to be able to click on a station that will then navigate them to a page that will show a report, we will also add the ability for users to create reports and edit them at will.

## Extension opportunities
> For extensions, We will show icons and identifiers on the heat map.
