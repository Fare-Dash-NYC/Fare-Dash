## What is it?
> Police officers are hiding in train stations, to get people who cannot afford the $2.75 fee. Theyâ€™re preying on black youth, using that as an excuse to stop and frisk and to fill their monthly quotas. Fare Dash is a full stack application designed to help users stay aware/notified of police presence in train stations.
